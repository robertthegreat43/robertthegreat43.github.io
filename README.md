<h2> Benefits and Risks of Cloud Computing</h2>

<p>Cloud Services Defined:</p>

<p>IaaS

What: is Infrastructure as a Service and is the foundation of all cloud computing
How: Processing , storage , networks and other computing resources on which everything 
else is based  And which customers rent or lease from the service provider
Challenges to Implementation: Risk include remote management , poor quality credentials and error in the execution of and the DNS protocal</p>

<p>PaaS

What: Platform as a service
How: programming language to deploy applications
Challenges to Implementation: needs to be securely deployed, this service is vulnerable to the
Normal cyber security threats and needs to be configured so.</p>

<p>SaaS

What: software as a Services
How: Includes applications running in the cloud that are accessed in a thin client manner or via the Web
Challenges to Implementation: the same as most application security problems encryption, and bad code but it has it most problems with pass word and password cracking.</p>


<h2>Current Strategies for Securing Cloud Computing Services
The most effective access controls:</h2>
<p>1) Broad Network access: standard mechanisms that promote the use of high end network 
Communications, such as phones etc.. These services are vulnerable and at risk of Dos
And attack that denies the client access to itâ€™s service.</p>

<p>2) Resource Pooling: The computing resources of a cloud system( e. g, storage , memory, processing, network bandwidth) are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Through different resources.

3) Data sharing: sharing information among different organizations is not a trivial task since 

A cloud system needs to meet the same security of organizations to achieves that
To facilitate data sharing , concepts such as trust of the federated identities and AC
Consumers are required to be responsible for the security of their cloud model,
Although a cloud service provider might take over the process.
4) I recommend that a security professional such as I be contracted to implement a secure structure and build the key elements of the AC to prepare for a possible and or  attack
This will involve encryption weather it is key values or not, there must be a way to control who can get into your space, who has access to what types of controls, are you an administrator or just a common user this all matters has to control.</p>








<h3>Cloud Computing Policy Development</h3>
<p>The Business side of the cloud industry looks to be a slight messy, There are a numerous of risk that could come to the light in when consider providers, Risk such as (loss of governance, loss of business reputation, and cloud served termination, and the ability to move data in case of provider collapse. There is a  problem with getting data out of the cloud and getting it back if the vendor collapse is Costly and difficult, the lock-in. Then there is interoperability the ability move through one or more cloud provides.</p>

<h6>Security in the Development Life Cycle



<p>SDL: is structured process that is used to design , developed and test good quality software
Planning, defining, designing, Building testing, and deployment.
The goal of this model is build maintainable data at a low cost that meets the user requirements
The precise plan tells how we develop maintain , replace and enhance specific software.
Planning defining design development System testing Deployment


<p>Stage 1 Planning:
Requirement analysis is preformed by developers of the entiy
The data from this report is used to perform the basic report.
	
Stage 2:
Defining a requirements this is where the software is customized for the user and gets approval by market analysis, and SRS. This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined during the whole project.</p>

<p>Stage 3: Designing Architecture:
SRS this a  reference for coders to look up and readily make the system for the software.
The requirements are already defined this made by the design document DDS.
	
Stage 4:
Developing the product, At this stage the fundamental development of the product starts for this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design. Conventional tools are also putt through this.</p>

<p>Stage 5
After this stage the development of the products is made testing of the product is necessary
To ensure its smooth execution. A well- written document acts as a tools, it provides infromations and training.</p>

<p>Stage 6:
After all of the above steps are done and testing is ensured that the product is a reliable and fit to be deployed, it is the giving to the user for the feed back and analysis.</p>
