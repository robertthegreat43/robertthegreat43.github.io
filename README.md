</h2>

<h3>Server Maintenance:</h3>
<p>
Server Maintenance is a essential pert of IT infrastructure running it smoothly and efficiently.
By running these check you can make sure you DB is operating smoothly.
1) Check server logs for any errors or alerts. Immediately resolving issues
2) Monitor system performance and resources usage to detect ant anomalies
3) Verify system backups and ensure they are running correctly
</p>

<h3>Account admiration:</h3>
<p>
Accounts with administrative and elevated privileges are necessary for both business and IT functions, but they present a significant risk to your organization in the hands of the careless or malcontent insider.
1)Discover all accounts with privileged access.
2)  Identity the owner of each privileged account.
3) Work with the owners to understand the purpose of each account
</p>

 <h2>access control:</h2>
 <p>
Auditing is an essential component of access controls it involves monitoring and recoding access patterns and activities.
1) Distributed IT Environments and the Adoption of clod computing
2) The rise of Mobility and remote work
3) Password Fatigue
4) Separate Identity Silos and Lack of Centralized User Directory
 </p>
<p>
The act of auditing is more the review of logs and new data entered into the system
It also allows the user to see if by the data, malformed or suspected information usely leads to a vulnerability or an exploit in the data tracking the data from un normal entries.

	Section 2 – Sarbanes-Oxley
</h2>
<p>
Sarbanes-Oxley is an act to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliable of the corporate disclosure’s made pursuit to the securities laws, and for other purposes. Introduced to the house as Corporate and Auditing Accountability, Responsibility and transparency Act pf 2002.This law mandates certain practices in financial record keeping and reporting for corporations. This law was enacted as a rection to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals , including ENRON, WORLDCOM. The act contains eleven titles, or sections , ranging, from additional corporate board responsibilities to criminal penalties.
</p>
<h3>
Examples:
</h3>
<p>
We know about Enron and the finical debocale  so I will not speak a lot on this topic let's move forward to two that we have never looked at before. 
1) World.com: 
During  a meeting with auditors, corporate finance director Sanjeev Sethi explained that differing amounts in two capital spending expenditures were related to “prepaid capacity”
Cooper had never heard of. When pressed for an explanation, Sethi claimed that he did not know what the term meant despite his division approving capital sending request. He referred the auditors to the corporate controller David Myers.
	Cooper and smith then questioned Betty , the accounting to the  director who made the entries. To their surprise, Vinson admitted she had made the entries without knowing what they were befor or seeing support for them. She had done this at the direction of Meyers and the general account director.
Myers admitted there was no support for the entries. He made them to what he thought they should be. The cooper’s team discovered 4 billion in questionable transfers from line cost.
</p>

<h3>What It means to IT: 
</h3>
<p>
A lot of It companies do a lot  of sharing of the data, let’s say and to build an overall typical power house. There could be a few small business that do small services for you as well as Large. In Fastly increasing and moving world such as IT,  What it means is that the customer of a 3 party work relation is not responsible for the accounts of the first two parties unless 
The accounts are the same, Yet it necessary for all levels of IT infrastructure  to look at this
Because we do a lot of licensing out, Because I use jet brains products and  run my environment on a JetBrains server and do my accounting there dose not make me liable for their actions. In my opinion the act makes the company lead accountant and the business administrator a little more edgy about what and who to do Businees with and who not to.
</p>

<h1>Section 3 – SOX POLICY
</h1>
<p>
The annual cost for compliance is $2.4M, and 565 of respondents say that compliance adds stress to their work. The Cost for non-Compliance is  a $4M
Overview:
The Sox Compliance is the act of adhering to the financial reporting auditing requirements  of the Sarbanes and Oakley act, To be compliant we must.
<h2>
Scope and Policy Details:
</h2>
In order to be Compliant we  need adhere to some Specific Policies, Scope to have secure Financial
Dealing with Home and Foreign companies In a securer, non-criminal infrastructure, Security sharing data, and protecting the privacy and the interest of each company while Having such dealings.
</p>
<h2>
Implement controls to protect Financial Data:
</h2>
<p>
We must adhere to the CIA tirade: Confidentiality: by keeping the data secure to the user that’s is supposed to be accessing it, Integrity: protecting this data in any form from being manipulated or accessed by a malicious user or some unforeseen event. The FISMA passed as apart of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the E- Government Act Of 2002. The act requires every government agency to secure the information as well as the information processing systems that support their  operations and assets, including those provided or managed by another agency, Contractor or other source.
</p>
<p>
1) Categorize the information to be protected.
2) Select the minimum baseline controls
3) Refine controls using the risk assessments procedures
4) Document the control in the system security plan
</p>

Enforcement and Punishment:
</h1>
<h2>
The HIPPAA Enforcement Rule:
</h2>
<p>The enforcement rule sets civil monetary penalties for violating the HIPAA rules and establishes procedures for investigation and hearing for identified victims
1) Administrative safeguards
2) A contingency plan
3) Physical safe guards
4) Technical safe guards
5) Access to information containing health information
Each of the above entity is responsible for ensuring thay the data within its system has not been changed.

<p>
Revision History: 
The revisions of each law has been inserted into the text above.
</p>

<p>
TOOLS and methods:
Computing environments have become complex, using the cloud and the internet.  The concept encompass the entire spectrum of the information security. Data security is the business of protecting ones Personal and or Privileged information.
</p>
<h3>CIA:
</h3>
<p>
1) Encryptions:
By turning normal text charters  in to an unreadable format, encryption keys scramble the data so that only authorized users can read it.
</p>
<p>
2) Data erasure:
Data uses software to completely overwrite data on any storage device, making it more secure than standard data wiping.
</p>
<p>
3) Data  masking:
Masking data allows teams to develop application o
R train people that use real data. It mask personal indefinable information so that development can occur in environments that are compliant.

		 <h>Communication Protocols Analysis and Recommendations:
		 </h>
<p>	 
The main components of the network are the ISP's equipment (routers, switches, and middleboxes connected bye transmission lines. The host or hub packet is sent transmits it to the nearest router, either on it's own LAN or over a point-to-point link to the ISP (dsl or cable) if the packet has not fully arrived then it stored until completed. The network layer provides services to the transport layer at the network layer/transport layer interface. An important question is precisely the kind that the service provides.
</p>
<h>	 
Application Layer:
</h>	
<p>
This is the highest layer and it is the primary layer that is responsible for interfacing with the  end-user. 
</p>
<h2>
Domain Name Service:
</h2>
<p>
Routing is done on networks by IP addressing for example if you wanted to send an e-mail to your friend you could use the IP address, The problem is you would have to have one for each user and you would have to update this also so this would be a lot of configure that you would not be able to keep up with.  The network admin  can map these addresses to address these needs or he can let the system do it, you will need to map these a .com or .Edu etc.. Each domain has it’s own individual mapping as we search for the ip address mapping to a specific name the data base is searched until the answer is found.
</p>
<p>
Electronic Mail or FTP: This also one of most used protocols, This consist of user post which allow people to send and receive e-mails.
</p>
<h3>
Hypertext Protocol:
</h3>
<p>
This is the protocols that is referred to as world wide web, The web consist of a collection of web server all over the world and they have hyperlinks to other pages. The client get access to the page by it’s URL, the browser must work with the DNs protocol to find the Ip address then it must work with TCP to make it to port 80 which is HTTP destination on the machine.
</p>

<h3>How these Protocols work with Hypothical Black Magic Game Desings:
</h3>	

<p>
In order for an Individual to even get to our site a client must use the DNS or Networking protocols once the receiver has it Domain the Client has the choice to use his/hers own, The user is prompted to use our self taught  courses to learn how to use our products, with hyperlinks we are able to send the user to different parts of the OS, that handle the specific task that the user is trying to complete while we apply the DNS protocols. For instance the client might want to make a project this project would be called C:\User\your name\project name, this would be loaded into a database and used to save the users progress or build and would also allow them to have a place  designated upon build, we must keep track of all logging and debugging if anything happens while trying to launch our platform any error we would expect logging, Thus we require FTP, for real time debugging of applications. HTTP, this would refer to the use of tools like flask Api or HTML5, Witch in accordance with our mobile applications will allow the client to view and play other clients games or use their assets, This protocols also work’s with database files to allow for rollback this is to allow payment to be made to us for our products or from other users. Also allowing text message from one virtual Machine to next in real time, while also keeping in line with DNS protocols. Because our destituted network is over mobile applications and Web-sites.
</p>



<h2>Network Traffic Analysis and Recommendations
</h2>
<p>
A distributed network is used to make communication and computer usage better, By using the IP/TCP, UDP etc.. A distributed network can connect a company to the cloud and provide internet to mobile devices, phones and tablets, this type of network is key business or home computing, The major uses of a distributed are.
</p>

<h>Analysis
Internet and web services: 
</h>
<p>
This internet itself is a distributed network effectively connecting user from all over the world at a website page or mobile application, this also a major source of information millions of user connect to the inert to find information.
</p>
<h>
Cloud Computing: the could is a virtual space network that con hold or control data and pass information at hide speeds most user hide personal data here business or cooperation might use the could to back up there data or to provide service that, clients can not provide for them selves life Iaas, or Paas, Saas, all which have there own unique strengths.
</h>
<p>
Social Media Platforms: These social sites use Paas and allow user to connect with other users, the have a high volume of traffic, from user post and interactions to ensure fast delivery.
</p>

<h2>Network Traffic: 
</h2>
<p>
Network Traffic peeks around 7pm and 11pm for the world wide web
Early Morning 4am – 7am
Late night 11pm – 4am
</p>
<h3>
	Recommendations
</h3>
<p>
My first Recommendation would be to use a Game Engine like Unity or Unreal since we are a startup and do not have one of our own or we are in the process of building 	our own. This allow for scalability and provide and adaptable platform in which we can distributed our games and get paid, I also recommend that in the creation of our own web site that we make this site to be used as link to any games, articles, blogs, reports, streams or webinars, This platform uses git for networking such as remote development and patching and the updating application
It is also my recommendation that we use Flask Api or Django, since we are going to build are own game Engine and just using one of these until the software is complete, We should use this software as a method to get information from the user and allow the user to interact with 	the application, though Post, Messaging, Sharing and Webinars.  We should use a Network monitoring tool like ManageEngine, This too analysis traffic flows and based on different tech and troubleshooting network issue quickly, optimizing data across your network by identifying bandwidth hogs and block or restrict them. Improved Network security, Detect traffic anomalies and drill down to the Ip addresses causing spike in the conversations. Classify and Manage traffic using templates Uses application differentiate services code point (DSCP) templated to classify and manage network traffic supports NetFlow, sFlow, J-flow Cflow, Netstrrem and appflow
