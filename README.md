- # Technical Essays

## Application Layer
Explained DNS, HTTP, and FTP protocols and their role in distributed systems.  
Applied concepts to game design networking (real-time debugging, rollback, multiplayer).

## Network Traffic Analysis
- Internet as a distributed network connecting millions of users.  
- Cloud computing (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) for scalability and data backup.  
- Social media platforms as high-volume distributed systems.  
- Traffic peaks: 7–11pm globally, 4–7am early morning, 11pm–4am late night.

## Recommendations
- Use Unity or Unreal for scalability until building a custom engine.  
- Employ Flask/Django APIs for prototypes and user interaction.  
- Implement ManageEngine for monitoring traffic flows, detecting anomalies, and improving network security.
