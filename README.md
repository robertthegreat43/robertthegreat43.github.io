<h2> Benefits and Risks of Cloud Computing</h2>

<p>Cloud Services Defined:</p>

<p>IaaS

What: is Infrastructure as a Service and is the foundation of all cloud computing
How: Processing , storage , networks and other computing resources on which everything 
else is based  And which customers rent or lease from the service provider
Challenges to Implementation: Risk include remote management , poor quality credentials and error in the execution of and the DNS protocal</p>

<p>PaaS

What: Platform as a service
How: programming language to deploy applications
Challenges to Implementation: needs to be securely deployed, this service is vulnerable to the
Normal cyber security threats and needs to be configured so.</p>

<p>SaaS

What: software as a Services
How: Includes applications running in the cloud that are accessed in a thin client manner or via the Web
Challenges to Implementation: the same as most application security problems encryption, and bad code but it has it most problems with pass word and password cracking.</p>


<h2>Current Strategies for Securing Cloud Computing Services
The most effective access controls:</h2>
<p>1) Broad Network access: standard mechanisms that promote the use of high end network 
Communications, such as phones etc.. These services are vulnerable and at risk of Dos
And attack that denies the client access to it’s service.</p>

<p>2) Resource Pooling: The computing resources of a cloud system( e. g, storage , memory, processing, network bandwidth) are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Through different resources.

3) Data sharing: sharing information among different organizations is not a trivial task since 

A cloud system needs to meet the same security of organizations to achieves that
To facilitate data sharing , concepts such as trust of the federated identities and AC
Consumers are required to be responsible for the security of their cloud model,
Although a cloud service provider might take over the process.
4) I recommend that I security professional such as I be contracted to implement a secure structure and build the key elements of the AC to prepare for a possible and or  attack
This will involve encryption weather it is key values or not, there must be a way to control who can get into your space, who has access to what types of controls, are you an administrator or just a common user this all matters has to control.</p>








<h3>Cloud Computing Policy Development</h3>
<p>The Business side of the cloud industry looks to be a slight messy, There are a numerous of risk that could come to the light in when consider providers, Risk such as (loss of governance, loss of business reputation, and cloud served termination, and the ability to move data in case of provider collapse. There is a  problem with getting data out of the cloud and getting it back if the vendor collapse is Costly and difficult, the lock-in. Then there is interoperability the ability move through one or more cloud provides.</p>


<p>Sample proposal:
Like I love to say we are all at risk and all though  there are new an nifty was to go about like the ten   Years in making AI, that will have us all secure if the hacker don’t figure it out first and the there are a few new technologies not prove in the makes that we hope will come into existence.
First and foremost most we must, understand the vulnerabilities that we can control, And educate the ones we cannot control.

<h4>Business Impact Analysis:</h4>
<p>BCP:
In the event of a malicious:
In the event of a Machine failure:
 It is necessary that we first Identify the faulty equipment, one natural Disaster can be avoid with a simple back up or a generator on the server to help with power failure,  and  Virtualization with virtual Machines and the ability to store data securely in the Cloud.
By  keeping up to date with current technologies and  applying the above techniques we can stay up and running during a natural disaster or a machine failure. Hot site: are located within another facility and has the same abilities, Turning on the controls in this site will run business as normal.
Warm site: Like hot sites have the same equipment and data as the main site. Going to this site and turning the Equipment and data as the main site.
Cold sites are located in a separate facility and can take week to get running. The Organization would need to wait for equipment to arrive and the information 
In the event of User Failure: 
Because we cannot be sure the user actions a and must try to prevent and or detect any breeches of security in this level of security, we may delete remove and banish said user.</p>


<p>DRP:
Data is the Big in clod computing and there is a very large need for security  and protection of Big Data. The company needs to perfume a risk analysis and have a BIA, Logging in all the  threats and new threats to clod Computing By using organizations like Cert we be able to create a threat level assessment
Create response: The BIA has a set of controls that will allow for businesses using cloud computing to be able to manage what they can manage, The Security Controls define a specific approach to each situations as cover in the risk management assessment.

Security in the Development Life Cycle
Software Assurance
TTG solutions is company dedicated to bringing innovative software solution to our users
We rely on simulation to create attacks that are not real and find real world solutions to the problem in a market that is making 45 billion dollars computer security is losing the solutions in networking is not working to solve this problems the firewalls that are supposed to be protecting, the asset and the data are not working CERT reported that there are over 538% percent  rise in attacks reported, Hacker are coming up with new and innovate ways to use malicious software as the new Hacker proclaim that they are able to use AI to create an attack on system this could be a real problem,
We believe the trick is to give the user maintainable data, systems and software that can be used and still be up through an attack on a network, Knowing That web security is one of these vulnerable issues. We the client may go on and simulate these types of attacks.














Software development life cycle

SDL: is structured process that is used to design , developed and test good quality software
Planning, defining, designing, Building testing, and deployment.
The goal of this model is build maintainable data at a low cost that meets the user requirements
The precise plan tells how we develop maintain , replace and enhance specific software.
Stage 1 Stage2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Stage 5 Stage 6
Planning defining design development System testing Deployment
Maintenance
Define project scope Functional
requirement HLD Coding
standards Manual testing Release
Planning
Set Objective and goals Technical
requirement LLD Scalable Codde Automated testing maintenance
Resource Planning Requirements
Reviews
Approved  Version control  Feedback

Stage 1 Planning:
Requirement analysis is preformed by developers of the entiy
The data from this report is used to perform the basic report.
Stage 2:
Defining a requirements this is where the software is customized for the user and gets approval by market analysis, and SRS. This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined during the whole project.
Stage 3: Designing Architecture:
SRS this a  reference for coders to look up and readily make the system for the software.
The requirements are already defined this made by the design document DDS.
Stage 4:
Developing the product, At this stage the fundamental development of the product starts for this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design. Conventional tools are also putt through this.
Stage 5
After this stage the development of the products is made testing of the product is necessary
To ensure its smooth execution. A well- written document acts as a tools, it provides infromations and training.

Stage 6:
After all of the above steps are done and testing is ensured that the product is a reliable and fit to be deployed, it is the giving to the user for the feed back and analysis.



Software assurance policies and procedures
SDLC is policy that is ensures  your software goes through testing and is built as secure as it can be.
Scrum, agile, sprints are some of the models.





Security in Non-traditional Model
Traditional software development models are simple to implement and have a high rate for success and also have a low security, they also use the a more Structured approach it follows a well developed methodologies that, the disadvantages is that the security is low and that it is not complexed more suited for the construction types. The testing is done late and if you have high maintenance   then you are in trouble, this model dose not or is not really built for the fixing patching and glueing and did I mentions that it is a security risk. 
Waterfall model: this is an example of the traditional model.
The non-traditional model such as agile methodologies offer a more reliant model that is design for maintenance   and the like the model is built  it is used for more complicated software and is an iterative process, while the traditional model is not the nontraditional model offers, Flexibility, Customer Involvement, continuous delivery, collaboration, early and frequent testing.
TGG solutions could use both models while the traditional model  is best suite for things like data base design, most likely the database will update its self and maintaining it will be not so complicated the traditional model fits best here.
The agile method the more complicated of the two process would be used to design the simulator and web applications, while the traditional model meets the requirements for this the security is not high enough or complicated enough for the process’s, While the traditional model is  efficient
It lacks the necessary collaborations to continuous to update and rebuild while the user is still using the application, here at TTG solutions we are giving solutions not becoming the problems.

Analysis:
Once more we desing simulations, using risk management and risk score we take high risk and try to level them down with, attacks happing more and not having the tools or resoruces to combat
These attacks we think that it imperative that we adress evey attack at its core foundations
By simulating know attacks and new we come up with more innovative was to stop hackes from
Steal valuable information from companys and users, gaining as much knowledge as possible
Our web-based applications is the same as our mobile app with the exception that the user may come has to have a password and have a name, This is for our recordes we keep track of your simulayed attacks and provide feed back and advice on how an ordinary user can use our tools to 
Stop an attack on an vulnerablity or an exploit in one software or web-based applications, we update our database  daily, Using Cert we collecte data about new attacks and how they are catogoriized, H/M/L
Attacks: Computer security is once more an ever changing and hard faught battle with all the different tools that can be used to break into one system one must be prepared and ready to take action. One of thetypes of attacks that we are vulnerable to is the XXS a crosss site scripting attack
It a vulnerablity in a web-application, that allows a milcios user to excute a script and it is one of the 
Most prevelant, This can compromise you account, deldet it or install malware infection
Using java script to read data from other websites, embedding them  and run scripts, it tricks the browser when input is not handle  properly by the response
Reflected XSS: if the input has time to be used, the payload delived directly to user and the payload becomes apart of the  script.
SQL injection: where the attcker user an sql injection

Guidelines:
Once more the CIA tirade must be used along with software assurance you want to catch bugs early
Every one makes mistakes and most mistakes will show up in code and can be easily fixed
But longer it lies dormant, the harder it is to fix. Creating simple tools or using them to debug code.
Auditing and testing for vulnerabilities is complicated along with static tool analysis, 
Aim for the best or great work and not for perfection, there is no way to cover all the issuer you may 
Have in security with a loosing battle on our hands we must even the field the best we can and one way to do that is to have good clean code and not perfect code.
This still requires human evaluation and a person must be patient and train their tools you will get a false negative at times, but these will go away.
Building Plans that are tailored for companies,
Best practices for initiatives
Train your people
Establish a continuous improvement capability
Its is necessary for our systems to remain up while we deal with these problems,
Therefore one must be prepare and ready, 
Adaption to change, sometimes the best thing are the hardest to believe, Its is necessary to above the learning curve.





Software Assurance Polices and Procedures
We believe first in keeping your data safe and in the right place ay the right time with minimal dely.
It necessary that all our staff is trained in network security protocols and able to manage and detect minor intrusions and risk in the private and professional field, the ability to detect an report malicious emails and phone calls and suspicious behavior by co-workers, we have security guards to check staff and data restricted to personal as well as assets and software. By using assets like IDS and IPS as well as sniffers such as Nessus and keeping up to date firewalls and security assets tools to quarantine and extract malicious packets from a company systems.

By providing data integrity in the form of Authentication we keep our user information easily and readily useable to the customer. We also advise that user use caution when using what ever method or asset the user is using, first pay attention to the passwords that you use and try to use something long and difficult also there is biometric validation too, and keeping the versions updated also, by informing the user of the methods that the hackers use we from another wall of protection around our data.

Last but not least, we believe that through the rigorous  methods of testing  to assure that your software is as agile as it can be, we maintain our data and the use of our applications through maintenance before we release anything into the public it must be tested, evaluated and then released, while we cannot chose for the user what to do with the software or application that the user is using we can only make suggestions and secure thing on our by also keeping the Score of the chance that a risk might be exploited and also using the government information that is available to us that update the types of attacks how to rate the and how to extract them.
