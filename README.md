<p> Benefits and Risks of Cloud Computing

Cloud Services Defined:

IaaS

What: is Infrastructure as a Service and is the foundation of all cloud computing
How: Processing , storage , networks and other computing resources on which everything 
else is based  And which customers rent or lease from the service provider
Challenges to Implementation: Risk include remote management , poor quality credentials and error in the execution of and the DNS protocal

PaaS

What: Platform as a service
How: programming language to deploy applications
Challenges to Implementation: needs to be securely deployed, this service is vulnerable to the
Normal cyber security threats and needs to be configured so.

SaaS

What: software as a Services
How: Includes applications running in the cloud that are accessed in a thin client manner or via the Web
Challenges to Implementation: the same as most application security problems encryption, and bad code but it has it most problems with pass word and password cracking.
</P>

<h2>Current Strategies for Securing Cloud Computing Services
The most effective access controls:</h2>
<p>1) Broad Network access: standard mechanisms that promote the use of high end network 
Communications, such as phones etc.. These services are vulnerable and at risk of Dos
And attack that denies the client access to it’s service.</p>

<p>2) Resource Pooling: The computing resources of a cloud system( e. g, storage , memory, processing, network bandwidth) are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model. Through different resources.

3) Data sharing: sharing information among different organizations is not a trivial task since 

A cloud system needs to meet the same security of organizations to achieves that
To facilitate data sharing , concepts such as trust of the federated identities and AC
Consumers are required to be responsible for the security of their cloud model,
Although a clod service provider might take over the process.
4) I recommend that I security professional such as I be contracted to implement a secure structure and build the key elements of the AC to prepare for a possible and or enable attack
This will involve encryption weather it is key values or not, there must be a way to control who can get into your space, who has access to what types of controls, are you an administrator or just a common user this all matters has to control.</p>








Cloud Computing Policy Development
The Business side of the cloud industry looks to be a slight messy, There are a numerous of risk that could come to the light in when consider providers, Risk such as (loss of governance, loss of business reputation, and cloud served termination, and the ability to move data in case of provider collapse. There is a  problem with getting data out of the cloud and getting it back if the vendor collapse is Costly and difficult, the lock-in. Then there is interoperability the ability move through one or more clod provides.


Sample proposal:
Like I love to say we are all at risk and all though  there are new an nifty was to go about like the ten   Years in making AI, that will have us all secure if the hacker don’t figure it out first and the there are a few new technologies not prove in the makes that we hope will come into existence.
First and foremost most we must, understand the vulnerabilities that we can control, And educate the ones we cannot control.

Business Impact Analysis:
BCP:
In the event of a malicious:
In the event of a Machine failure:
 It is necessary that we first Identify the faulty equipment, one natural Disaster can be avoid with a simple back up or a generator on the server to help with power failure,  and  Virtualization with virtual Machines and the ability to store data securely in the Cloud.
By  keeping up to date with current technologies and  applying the above techniques we can stay up and running during a natural disaster or a machine failure. Hot site: are located within another facility and has the same abilities, Turning on the controls in this site will run business as normal.
Warm site: Like hot sites have the same equipment and data as the main site. Going to this site and turning the Equipment and data as the main site.
Cold sites are located in a separate facility and can take week to get running. The Organization would need to wait for equipment to arrive and the information 
In the event of User Failure: 
Because we cannot be sure the user actions a and must try to prevent and or detect any breeches of security in this level of security, we may delete remove and banish said user.


DRP:
Data is the Big in clod computing and there is a very large need for security  and protection of Big Data. The company needs to perfume a risk analysis and have a BIA, Logging in all the  threats and new threats to clod Computing By using organizations like Cert we be able to create a threat level assessment
Create response: The BIA has a set of controls that will allow for businesses using cloud computing to be able to manage what they can manage, The Security Controls define a specific approach to each situations as cover in the risk management assessment.
